# Tool chain config files

The Tool chain config file tells ToolDAQ what to run and how to run it.
Important parameters are the `Tools_File` which is the path to the [Tools config file](Tools_config_files.md) containing the tools you want to run,
Run Type which has 3 options (`Inline`, `Interactive`, and `Remote`) to flag, and 
`verbose` (set to 9 for all messages, 0 for none). See the [ToolDAQ documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18rgYMOAGt3XiW9i0qN9kfUK1ssbQgLV1gQgG3hyVUoA/edit) for more detailed information.
